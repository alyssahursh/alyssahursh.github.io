Additional work to be done:
-Refactor CSS to be more DRY.
-Create multiple style sheets rather than just one to make specific code easier to find.
-Add section break names to CSS.
-Add additional navlink level, right-left arrows, or similar to individual code pages to make it easier to switch between those pages. (See bottom of http://studionudge.com/hay-rosie-ice-cream for one implementation style).
-Resize images for faster loading.
-Handle mobile phone screens.
