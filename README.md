## About this portfolio
* This was my static website I ever made, and was done after written after just one week of learning HTML and CSS.
* The design was borrowed from [Studio Nudge](http://studionudge.com) as an exercise in writing code to match visuals created by someone else.
* The site is not mobile-responsive (I hadn't yet learned about media queries).
* Page load time is very slow because the images are far too large.
